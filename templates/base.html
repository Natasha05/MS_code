            <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b01391">MS2LDA+</a>, In untargeted metabolomics approaches, the inability to structurally annotate relevant features and map them to biochemical pathways is hampering the full exploitation of many metabolomics experiments. Furthermore, variable metabolic content across samples result in sparse feature matrices that are statistically hard to handle. Here, we introduce MS2LDA+ that tackles both above-mentioned problems. Previously, we presented MS2LDA, which extracts biochemically relevant molecular substructures (“Mass2Motifs”) from a collection of fragmentation spectra as sets of co-occurring molecular fragments and neutral losses, thereby recognizing building blocks of metabolomics. Here, we extend MS2LDA to handle multiple metabolomics experiments in one analysis. By linking Mass2Motifs across samples, we expose the variability in prevalence of structurally related metabolite families.

        <h2>Decomposition Analysis</h2>
        <p style="font-size:90%;">
           Considering how to store the structural information received from LDA run in such a way that it can be easily transferred to new experiments and how to make it searchable for the scientific community, for example, by converting them into MassBank records, decomosition functionality was introduced.Decomposition allows for spectra in a dataset to be decomposed onto a set of pre-defined motifs from another experiment, this is clearly a benefit. Another benefit is that annotations can also be directly transferred from the original pre-defined Mass2Motifs to new and unseen dataset (without having to perform a motif matching step).<br/>
            Following decomposition idea, This project aims to analyze decomposed data returned from decomposition API using a web based tool. In MS2LDA+, the full LDA scan was performed on all samples together in order to find topic prevalence and annotations. This project follows the decomposition idea, to allow the use of previously retrieved information from the LDA run and uses that as the motifset for the identification of molecules/motifs. This requires the spectra of sample data needs to be loaded with the particular motifset e.g massbank_motifset, gnps_massbank_combined and gnps_motifset to the decomposition API server. The decomposition API will return the results in a specific format. For this project, we are interested in the alpha vector of motifs returned from API. The aim of this project is to analyze these alpha values and expose biochemical differences across samples, along with the differential prevalence of motifs, using a web based tool that is developed as part of this project. This webapp will allow researchers to do similar analysis on decomposition results as they did when using MS2LDA+ to understand the disease.
